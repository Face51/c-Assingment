Enter two numbers (a and b): 10 20

Initial values: a = 10, b = 20
[Call by Value]
Before Swap: x = 10, y = 20
After Swap:  x = 20, y = 10

After Call by Value : a = 10, b = 20
[Call by Reference]
Before Swap: x = 10, y = 20
After Swap:  x = 20, y = 10

After Call by Reference : a = 20, b = 10








Pointer to Constant:
ptr1 points to a = 10
After changing address, ptr1 now points to b = 20

Constant Pointer:
ptr2 points to a = 10
After modifying value through ptr2, a = 25






Enter two numbers: 10 30 

Before Swapping: x = 10, y = 30
After Swapping : x = 30, y = 10
